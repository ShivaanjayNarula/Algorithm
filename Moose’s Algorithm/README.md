**<h1>Moose's Algorithm</h1>**

Moose's Algorithm is a technique used to solve certain types of dynamic programming problems, particularly those that involve optimization problems on sequences or arrays. It is a generalization of the "Divide and Conquer" approach and is often used to reduce the complexity of problems that would normally require brute force solutions.

It is commonly used in problems involving:

**Dynamic Programming:** Specifically, it is used for optimization problems, where decisions are made at each step and depend on previous steps.

**Range Queries:** Problems that involve optimizing over a range of values, such as finding the maximum or minimum over a range.

**<h3>Key Points:</h3>**

Optimization with Divide and Conquer: Moose's Algorithm involves a form of divide-and-conquer where the problem is recursively divided into smaller subproblems, and the results of those subproblems are merged.

**Efficiency:** The algorithm optimizes dynamic programming problems that would otherwise take quadratic time (O(n^2)) by reducing them to O(n log n) time using clever recursion and merging.

Typical Applications:

Range optimization problems.

DP problems with monotonic properties.

Problems that involve segment trees or dynamic programming states transitioning based on previous states.
