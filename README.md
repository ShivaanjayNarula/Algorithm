# Algorithm Design & Implementation

This repository contains the code developed during the **Algorithm Design & Implementation** class. The objective is to provide a collection of algorithms implemented in C++, along with their explanations, complexities, and use cases. Each algorithm is designed to solve specific computational problems and is implemented with a focus on performance and clarity.

## Contents

The repository is organized by topics covered in the class, each with its own folder containing:
- Problem statement
- Solution code
- Explanation of the algorithm
- Time and space complexity analysis

### Topics Covered:
1. **Sorting Algorithms**  
   - Bubble Sort  
   - Merge Sort  
   - Quick Sort  
   - Heap Sort

2. **Greedy Algorithms**  
   - Activity Selection Problem  
   - Huffman Encoding

3. **Dynamic Programming**  
   - Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)  
   - Knapsack Problem  
   - Matrix Chain Multiplication

4. **Graph Algorithms**  
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm  
   - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm  
   - Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s and Kruskal’s)

5. **Divide and Conquer**  
   - Binary Search  
   - Merge Sort  
   - Closest Pair Problem

6. **Backtracking**  
   - N-Queens Problem  
   - Subset Sum Problem

7. **Advanced Data Structures**  
   - Segment Tree  
   - Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)

## Structure

- Each folder is named after the algorithm or problem it contains.
- The folder includes:
  - `problem.txt`: A brief description of the problem or algorithm.
  - `solution.cpp`: The C++ implementation of the algorithm.
  - `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the approach used and complexity analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShivaanjayNarula/Algorithm-Design-and-Implementation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the specific folder to see the code and problem statements.

## Prerequisites

- To run the C++ code, you will need a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++).
- Basic understanding of C++ and algorithms is recommended.

## Usage

To compile and run any of the solutions, use the following commands in the respective algorithm's directory:

```bash
g++ solution.cpp -o solution
./solution
