# Sliding Window Algorithms

The sliding window technique is a powerful method used to solve problems related to arrays and strings efficiently, often reducing the time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

## 1. Fixed-size Sliding Window

**Use case**: When the size of the window (`k`) is fixed.

**Examples**:
- Maximum sum of subarray of size k
- First negative integer in every window of size k
- Maximum of all subarrays of size k (Deque based)

---

## 2. Variable-size Sliding Window (a.k.a. Dynamic Sliding Window)

**Use case**: When the window size is not fixed; expand and contract the window based on some condition.

**Examples**:
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Minimum size subarray sum â‰¥ target
- Longest subarray with sum â‰¤ k
