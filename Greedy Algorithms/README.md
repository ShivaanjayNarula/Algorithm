# GREEDY ALGORITHMS

## What is Greedy Algorithm?
 A greedy algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the **locally optimal** option with the hope that this leads to a **globally optimal** solution.

## STRUCTURED GREEDY TYPES AND PROBLEMS

### 1. **Interval-Based Greedy**

**Core Idea:**  
Sort by start or end times â†’ pick intervals that donâ€™t overlap.

**Common Problems:**
- Activity Selection / Non-overlapping Intervals
- Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
- Meeting Rooms / Meeting Rooms II
- Partition Labels
- Erase Overlapping Intervals
- Minimum Platforms (Train Schedules)

---

### 2. **Graph-Based Greedy**

**Core Idea:**  
Pick smallest/largest weights (MST, shortest path), usually with sorting or heap.

**Common Problems:**
- Kruskal's Algorithm (MST using union-find)
- Prim's Algorithm (MST using priority queue)
- Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm (Shortest path using PQ)
- Greedy Coloring of Graph

---

### 3. **Greedy with Sorting + Priority Queue**

**Core Idea:**  
Sort based on profit/value/weight and take max from heap.

**Common Problems:**
- Job Sequencing with Deadlines
- Fractional Knapsack
- Greedy Florist
- Optimal Merge Pattern
- Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes

---

### 4. **Greedy with Strings/Arrays**

**Core Idea:**  
Choose character/element with highest or lowest priority at each step.

**Common Problems:**
- Reorganize String
- Remove K Digits
- Lexicographically Smallest String
- Monotone Increasing Digits
- Task Scheduler
- Candy Distribution
- Lemonade Change
- Gas Station Problem

---

### 5. **Greedy with Currency/Resources**

**Core Idea:**  
Use the **largest denomination first**, or minimize the number of operations.

**Common Problems:**
- Minimum Number of Coins
- Coin Change (Greedy variant)
- Egyptian Fraction
- Water Bottles (LeetCode 1518)

---

### 6. **Greedy Path/Steps**

**Core Idea:**  
Choose the farthest reachable step or minimum steps ahead.

**Common Problems:**
- Jump Game I & II
- Wiggle Subsequence
- Can Place Flowers
- Minimum Jumps to Reach End
